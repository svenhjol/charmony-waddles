This is a port of [Waddles](https://github.com/GirafiStudios/Waddles) by GirafiStudios to work with the Charmony suite of mods on fabric.

## How to build?

Clone the project and run the gradle build task. A game jar file and source jar file will be output to `build/libs`. 
Charmony core and API will be automatically bundled into the game jar so there are no dependencies other than Fabric API.

Targets **Minecraft 1.21.5** only.
